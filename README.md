# Places
My place finder app powered by Google Places API. It will NOT be published due to Google's terms of service :(

Current features:
-Places pinged from Google Places API Web Service
-Filtering of places into categories of Google Places API types. However, each place will still be denoted by their Google Places API type by icon
-A detailed view for each place appears when a list item is clicked. Details fetched from Google Places API for Android
-Distance and time to each place from the user's current location, given for all four supported transportation modes
-Links to places' websites and phone numbers, if pinged
-Allows user to vary the radius (distance from current location) that places are pinged
-Allows user to search for places by keyword
-A layout for xlarge screens (tablets) is ready, however due to the publisher's lack of availability of tablets to test on, this app will only function on phones for now
-Support for four languages (English, German, French and Chinese). Will aim to support ten
